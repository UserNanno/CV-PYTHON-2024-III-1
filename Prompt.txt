Generate a hyper-realistic, professional-quality photograph of a 40-year-old rural Peruvian woman entrepreneur, reflecting her pride and determination in starting her small business. She has shoulder-length wavy black hair, light brown skin, and wears a traditional yet practical apron, indicating her hands-on work in a small business, such as a local market, café, or agricultural stand. Her expression is warm and confident, as she smiles proudly while holding a tool relevant to her work, like a spray bottle, a basket of fresh produce, or a notebook for orders.

The environment is a modest yet colorful rural setting, with natural light coming from a nearby window or outdoor space. The background should include rustic elements typical of rural Peru, such as wooden shelves, clay pots, or handwoven textiles, creating an authentic and inviting atmosphere. Vibrant colors like reds, purples, and warm earthy tones (terracotta, mustard yellows) should dominate the scene, adding a sense of energy and cultural richness.

The lighting is natural and soft, casting gentle shadows on her face and surroundings, highlighting the textures of her clothing, the fabric of her apron, and the items around her. The image should capture fine details such as the texture of her skin, the material of her apron, and the rustic surfaces in the background. The photograph should have the clarity and lifelike quality of an image taken with an iPhone 15 Pro Max, with realistic depth and vibrant, true-to-life colors that reflect her hardworking and entrepreneurial spirit in a rural Peruvian setting.
